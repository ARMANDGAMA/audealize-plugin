#What is Audealize?
Audealize is a new way of looking at audio production tools. Instead of the traditional complex interfaces consisting of knobs with hard-to-understand labels, Audealize provides a semantic interface for controlling EQ and reverb effects. Simply load one of the Audealize plugins into your DAW of choice, then describe the type of sound you're looking for in the search boxes or click and drag around the maps to find new effects.

*A note for GarageBand users: Audealize stores configuration data in /Library/Application/Audealize Support and ~/Library/Application Support/Audealize. Due to the way GarageBand sandboxes its plugins, it will request that you lower security settings in order to use Audealize.*
